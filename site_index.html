<h2><strong>Welcome to...</strong></h2>

<em>...a wholly different experience.</em>

<strong>We</strong> aren't your big box store with drone workers, unfriendly and un-knowledgeable service, old bait, or random products forced into your hands by the industry.

<strong>We</strong> aren't your small local shop with limited tackle or bait selection. <strong>We</strong> have what you need to take your fishing to the next level.

<strong>We</strong> are <strong><em>Johnston Bait & Tackle</strong></em>, the perfect mix of your Local Bait Shop and Big Box Store.<br>
<strong>We</strong> have the Products that work right here in Iowa, and access to Special Run or Limited Items.<br>
<strong>We</strong> have the personal connections with many Industry Reps across the Country to get you the inside scoop on products and knowledge.<br>
<strong>We</strong> have Personal Knowledge of the Waters surrounding Des Moines, and across the State.<br>
<strong>We</strong> go the extra mile to put the best equipment and bait in your hands.

<strong>We</strong> are <strong><em>Johnston Bait & Tackle</strong></em>.

With a wide selection of Reels, Rods, Accessory Goods, and Premium Baits We at Johnston Bait & Tackle strive to make your fishing trip the best one until the next one.
